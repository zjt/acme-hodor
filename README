Acme::Hodor version 1.00
    Acme::Hodor - For *really* clean programs

SYNOPSIS
            use Acme::Hodor;

            print "Hello world";

DESCRIPTION
    The first time you run a program under `use Acme::Hodor', the
    module removes all the unsightly printable characters from your
    source file. The code continues to work exactly as it did before,
    but now it looks like this:

            use Acme::Hodor;
                                                                                             
INSTALLATION

    It's all pure Perl, so just put the .pm file in its appropriate
    local Perl subdirectory.
